1. In step 1, which Linux commands did you use to (1) create a new folder and (2) copy
your files into a new folder?
        I used mkdir to make a new folder and cp to copy.
2. Could any of the breadth-first-search questions (shortestPath and distanceUser) be
solved with depth-first-search? Why or why not?
        Shortest path and Distance user cannot be solved by a DFS because diving all the way to the leaf nodes leads to a path but that path is not guaranteed to be the most optimal path.
3. Could the depth-first-search question (groups) be solved with breadth-first-search?
Why or why not?
        Yes, groups can be solved using a BFS algorithm using the same method where we keep running BFS on a unvisited user to form a new group and repeat until every user has been visited.
4. Can the suggestFriends problem be solved without breadth-first-search and depth-first-
search?
        Yes, the suggestFriends problem can be solved without BFS or DFS. For example, you can brute force and compare every user to find the ones with the most similarity.
5. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your shortestPath implementation in
terms of n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?
        O(n+m) since its dominated by the BFS algo.
6. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your groups implementation in terms of
n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?
        O(n+m)
7. In hours, (approximately) how much time did you spend on this assignment? (there
are no wrong answers)
        around 2hrs
