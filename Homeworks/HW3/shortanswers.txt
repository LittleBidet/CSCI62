1. Why do we store the posts as a vector of Post pointers, and not as a vector of Posts?
There are two main reasons.
        We want to store the posts as a vector of post pointers because it allows us to also store LinkPost objects by casting them into Post. Morevover, it also allows for LinkPost objects to retain their unique traits.
2. In LinkPost::toString(), why can you not access the message field directly?
        We cannot access the message field directly because message is a private variable in Post which forces us to use a getter.
3. You want to call the Post::toString method for Posts and LinkPost::toString
method for LinkPost in User::getPostsString. What keyword makes this possible, and where does that keyword go?
        The virtual keyword makes this possible. It goes in the function declaration of the parent class.
